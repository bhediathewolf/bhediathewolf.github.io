        <p class="subtext editable">This is (obviously) my blog. The blog is an outlet for ideas. It is also a subtle attempt at a conversation that I hope you, my dear visitor, engage me in.</p>
        <p class="subtext editable">I am always quite intrigued by Scandinavian culture. The name of the blog, 'Leita', is an Icelandic verb that means 'to search'. In a way, this blog is my search for something, which I find hard to define at the moment. It is also, a documentation of this very vague search.</p>
        <p class="subtext editable">The reason I started this blog is to share my ideas whilst exploring uncharted waters. For example, I used to stubborn about not working with html/css because I was, honestly, scared. Yet, here I am writing this blog's code (most of it, anyways).</p>
