        <p class="subtext editable">Never Thought So! is a philosophical appreciation of our nothingness in the universe. To elaborate, I never thougth I would write a blog, ever. Because, there are so many! And, who really reads blogs, right?! Yet, here I am. Life is full of such things you never think you would do.</p>
        <p class="subtext editable">I am Sannidhya Sandheer. I like to think and create. This is one of those thoughts that became a reality. I like most things tech. I love thought experiments. I have a thing for discarding coursework and following my own things. This has come to bite me in the ass a few times.</p>
        <p class="subtext editable">The idea behind NeverThoughtSo! is an intellectually engaging experience for both, the writer and the reader, so that it is an investment inward to write and to read. The world is so full of frustrated souls that the art of debate and open mind has been lost. So, it can be called a journey where everyone is invited.</p>
