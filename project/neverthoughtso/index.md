The cost of this website.

NeverThoughtSo! is a website that is an amalgamation of the free tools available online. It is hosted on Github Pages for free. Github Pages uses Jekyll to render static sites.

Jekyll has a rigid structure within which it allows criminal levels of freedom. It has been built with blogging in mind. It extends Liquid into something more blog centric, though it's not far off.

The website uses:
- Github Pages for hosting, _free_
- GoDaddy's .com domain, _$10_
- CloudCannon's Frisco free theme, _free_
- AddThis Share Button, _free_
- AddThis Subscription Form, _free_
- Google Analytics, _free_
- Google Search Console, _free_
- Disqus Comments, _free_
- Travis CI for builds, _free_
- CloudFlare CDN and SSL, _free_

Using Github Pages and the amount of work put into it is a personal choice because the more you invest into building the site itself, the more options you will get. If you are looking for a one time setup and leave site, Github Pages is the way to go. That's how it was intended.
If you are looking for something with more freedom, you can always ditch Github Pages for Amazon S3, another free hosting service for static sites. This relieves you of certain restrictions Github puts on you when using Github Pages.
