lare.js is the successor project of [jquery-pjaxr](/project/jquery-pjaxr/).

It is managed by the [lare-team](https://github.com/lare-team) which consists at
the time of writing of me and [Jonas](http://iekadou.com/) (the author of
[django-pjaxr](https://github.com/iekadou/django-pjaxr))

Our goal is to bundle all plugins in the team and to find contributors who like
to maintain and extend this project with us.

So if you like to join our team or create a plugin for your platform of interest
- get in touch: message me on twitter.
