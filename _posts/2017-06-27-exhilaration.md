An adventure aficionado seeks thrill in her ability to come out unscathed from a truly endearing experience.
How can one shy away from the opportunity to challenge their fears, themselves.
A [2012 study](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17473611211203948 "Dean, D. H. (2012)") answers this phenomenon of literally seeking death as a developmental gap between "logical reasoning and impulse control".
It further adds, "young people are as aware as older adults of the risks in a behavior, but unlike older adults, they may be less able to control the temptation to seek the thrill."
in [the words of Machine Gun Kelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnFr4MP7Tjo), "I can't feel nothin' outside these Dre beats".
There exists a faint argument, to iterate in the most humble way, that some seek similar invincibility with as much disregard for their careers.

> They derive exhilaration not from stagnation of inability but from the subsequent stimulation mentally to convert it to a challenge and, the sense of accomplishment or, even perfection by making it their ability.

In seeking a more psychological dissection of the thrill seekers and, contrasting them with our high risk individuals, few similarities are uncanny.
These can be structurally explored through what, why, where, who and, how?

### What is 'inability'?
Both of our high risk individuals seek a challenge.
The key part is the sheer size of the mountain they seek to conquer, so to speak.
True intellectual seduction is witnessed through external and internal affirmations of inability of performance.

> They grow by creating boundaries, and then, denouncing them.
> It is simply the only way they learn.

But the challenges they undertake are very binary.
It is either a total annihilation or a priceless moment savored only by them.

### But, why?
One might snide these activities as mere egoistic obligation.
The fun part is how accomplishments, with time, humble us more than them, especially about their approach to discomfort.

> Their comfort zone is the one of discomfort.
> It is here they feel in more natural habitat than within the clutches of comforting inaction.

There is a bitter sweet taste in accomplishing something against the odds.
In the most premature nature, this exists in procrastinators who outperform themselves under pressure.
A [2009 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19425357 "Choi, J. N., & Moran, S. V. (2009)") outlining _active procrastination_ "found that active procrastinators did possess desirable behavioral and attitudinal characteristics, leading to positive personal outcomes."
I shall even go out on a limb to claim these individuals fear monotony and blandness of the work environment.
This is often supplemented with a casual disregard for the more societal essentials like money.
These individuals' drive for stimulation is more morally instilled than their peers.

### Where are the board rooms of these rock climbers?
Historically, such individuals have continually captivated themselves with whatever piqued their interest.
In the last few decades, innovation has been at light speed.
One true scale of it are computers.
To study the history of computers against anything else, one easily concludes the speed of innovation has been unparalleled.
From a supportive equipment, it has become the sole occupation of millions.

> The nature of computers is, indeed, peculiar. It's ever so rigid structure can inspire such a free flow of invention.
> Where computers out shine other pursuits of stimulation like arts, sports, etc is how it combines a great theoretical literature with practical implementation; above all, how the journey of idea from inception to realization is marked by not only creation of the core but also, the supporting architecture. 

This is where high risk individuals feel most comfortable.
From a place of frustration, infested with bugs and, a wild goose chase for an idea so abstract that would be realized so quite differently.

### Who are these high risk individuals?
We can mostly talk in characteristics but we are not short of examples.
These individuals are cut from the same cloth as Frankenstein.
They are guided often by a self drive of intellectual stimulation shrouded by universal problems.

> Most successful entrepreneurs are the poster boys for this school of thought.
> They are the most prominent project hoppers who are seeking constant engagement of their mental faculties.
> You can think of your staple tech giants; Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerburg, Larry Page, Jeff Bezos.
> Essentially, every passionate programmer solving the next big problem is a high risk individual high on the adrenaline of inability.

The nature of technology in the past few decades has been so fast paced, it is impossible to keep up.
The forefront of technology and research has become more historic anecdote if not an illusion.
Today, the innovation is more distributed than ever before.
This explosion is fueled by individuals whose zeal to achieve trumps the traditional constructs of formal education.

But the idea of creation for mere internal satisfaction is as old as any.
From the earliest Indian and Greek schools of thought to 17th and 18th century revolutionary artists, scientists and polymaths.
> The individuals who would exact more satisfaction from the challenges posed rather than it's valuation in open market have been, are and, will continue to form the foundations of innovation.

### How are they embracing their shortcomings?
High risk individuals follow a three step process of identifying a challenge that is generously against the odds.
They are motivated to then, pursue it to fruition.
After a long strenuous pursuit, they achieve their goals.
Of course, the nuances of this are much deeper and subtle than a three step process.
Akin to 12 step programs for addicts, it is an all around test of the human being.
Thread by thread, their moral fabric is tested.

> The task is riddled with certainty of stagnation.
> Every such block tests perseverance, grit and, commitment.

The experimentation with what clicks starts early, in childhood.
As an adolescent, they get a clearer picture of what can they passionately pursue.
Much like computers, they are rigid in their approach.
Also like computers, within this rigidity, they are creative in their pursuits and how to adapt themselves to be passionate about.

## Conclusion
While many individuals find themselves in a loop, exhausted from the metaphorical straight jacket, we have _high risk individuals_ who make a show out of it.
Much like Houdini, they appear to out of shackles because they are not concerned with responsibilities outwardly in.
Rather they approach responsibilities inwardly out.
The subtlety lies in priority of self and those around us.
Are not grades, fame, money more of an enabler of those around us than us?

> The idea is _not_ about "not giving up".
> Rather it is cherishing the unknown.

If we all agree that it is, indeed, until we are learning that we live, then __why the unknown scares us?__
