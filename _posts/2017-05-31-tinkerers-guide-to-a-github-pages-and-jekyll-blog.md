I often came across personal blogs wherein people often documented their encounters with certain softwares which, now, acted as a guide. This resulted in me, at times, romancing the idea of my own blog. I tried various blogging sites like Tumblr, Medium, etc. but I always lacked something; sometimes quality, or viewers, and quite regularly, the motivation. Then, in late April, 2017, I found [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a essentially a free website hosting service which restricts hosting to only static websites. Even so, these sites are generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a beautiful way to generate websites. It allows the user to *setup and forget*. I had found myself a little project. The following is an exhaustive guide because I found existing guides to heavily rely on the assumed proficiency of the reader; I don't. 

This guide is structured into 15 chapters. Each chapter has been created with an emphasis on only a very specific section of your blog. Additionally, in spite of such specific tasks, it provides the reader with confidence to independently to partake in any activity related to the upkeep of the blog.

**Caution: _There is an assumption here, that the reader will be hosting their site using Github Pages. The impact of this is such, Github Pages lacks support for custom plugins and, in effect, a large number of plugins available for Jekyll. That being said, it does, however [support a specific set of plugins a blog cannot do without](https://pages.github.com/versions/) That being said, [it possible to use external plugins with Github Pages](https://blog.sorryapp.com/blogging-with-jekyll/2014/01/31/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html), but that isn't within the scope of this guide, yet._**

List of chapters:
1. [Getting Started][1]
2. [Walkthrough][2]
3. [Personalization][3]
4. [Comments][4]
5. [Contact Forms][5]
6. [Category][6]
7. [Subscription Forms][7]
8. [Share Buttons][8]
9. [Google Intregration][9]

11. [Markdown][11]
12. [Google Ads][12]
13. [Mobile Layout][13]
14. [Workflow][14]
15. [Conclusion][15]

Throughout the guide, I will recreate, essentially, my entire website through a new github account, created specifically for this guide. The edited code will be public on Github for the ease of the reader. 

Needless to say, if you have any doubts, just comment on relevant on post, or shoot me an email using the contact form.
